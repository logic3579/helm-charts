## Usage
### Build a Helm package

To create a helm chart

    helm create charts/my-chart

Check configuration for all charts

    helm lint charts/*

Package all helm chart into chart archive

    cd docs && helm package ../charts/*

### GitHub Pages example

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

[GitHub Pages settings](https://github.com/yakir3/helm-charts/settings/pages), use branch gh-pages and folder docs.

Index and publish helm package

    helm repo index ../docs --url https://yakir.top/helm-charts
    git push origin

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add my-repo https://yakir3.github.io/helm-charts
    # or
    helm repo add my-repo https://yakir.top/helm-charts/

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  
You can then run `helm search repo my-repo` to see the charts.

Install the my-app chart:

    helm install my-chart my-repo/my-chart

Uninstall the chart:

    helm uninstall my-chart

### GitLab package registry

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) must be installed to use. Please refer to
GitLab's [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/helm_repository/) to get started.

Install helm cm-push plugin

    # https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push
    helm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push

Authenticate to the Helm repository, get username and token from GitLab

Index and publish helm package

    helm repo add --username <username> --password <access_token> my-repo https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/helm/stable
    helm cm-push mychart-0.1.0.tgz my-repo

Install the my-app chart:

    helm install my-chart my-repo/my-chart

Uninstall the chart:
